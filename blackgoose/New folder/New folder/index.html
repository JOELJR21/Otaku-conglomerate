<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Level 1: Straight out of the Oven!</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Level 2: Juicy burgers!</h2>

People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Level 3: Gone Fishing</h2>
<p>Who doesn't love a good fried cod or salmon? Get a load of our fresh choices of fish served with our tartar sauce.</p>

<h2>Level 4: Love that Chicken from Black Goose!</h2>
<p>Hand-breaded and seasoned with a hint of TLC! Freshly prepared from our top chefs in the kitchen. Who doesn't love a good fried chicken meal?</p>

<h2>Level 5: Golden Crisp</h2>
<p>Better than any pre-packaged fries, these fries are hand-cut, fried in canola oil fryers and seasoned with a dash of oregano and sea salt. Delicious!</p>

<h2>Level 6: Going Green</h2>
<p>Don't worry, we haven't forgotten about our green thumbs. You can enjoy a nice bowl of healthy fresh greens along with our Arab speciality, the Tabouleh.</p>
