<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Baker's Corner</h2>
<p><a href="bread.jpg"><img src="bread-400.jpg" alt="bread-400"></a><br>
Our lovely baker Ms. Donna, hand bakes our delicious yeast rolls, blueberry muffins, and our iconic wheat bread. It goes perfectly with a nice cup of baked potato soup. </p>

<h2>Off the Grill</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.jpg"><img src="burgers-400.jpg" alt="burgers-400"></a><br>
</p><p>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. The chefs that do it justice are Victor and Randy. They grind our ground beef daily and smear the patties with a dash of bouillon and a spark of salt. </p>

<h2>Gone Fishin</h2>
<p><a href="fish.jpg"><img src="fish-400.jpg" alt="fish-400"></a><br>
</p><p>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Sailor Larry and his sous chef Linda serve up a nice lemon garnished salmon with a hearty cup of clam chowder straight from New England!</p>

<h2>Our Golden Poultry</h2>

<p>
  One thing about Black Goose is that we don't leave out the classic chicken. Mrs. Nancy, our chicken expert, hand breads each cutlet with a premium panko breading and
  follows it up with a side of french fries.
</p>


<h2>French Fries</h2>

<p>
  Speaking of french fries, these golden straws of heaven are to make your mouth water with delight.
  Cut to perfection and seasoned with a hint of salt, these iconic side items will having come back for more!
</p>

<h2>Tabouleh A La Mode</h2>
<a href="tabouleh.jpg"><img src="tabouleh-800.jpg" alt="tabouleh-800"></a><br>
<p>
  Why not spice up your dining experience with a little Arabian flavor? This classic dish chopped, sliced, diced, and garnished with care.
  Irma, our Arabian culinary expert, puts a little home spice to this dish. We may be called Black Goose, but we can't stick to one audience. Diversity is our number one moral we stand by!
